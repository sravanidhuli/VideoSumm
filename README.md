### Datasets and VASNet pretrained models
You will also need the datasets as provided in [VASnet](https://github.com/ok1zjf/VASNet).
Preprocessed datasets TVSum, SumMe, YouTube and OVP as well as VASNet pretrained models can be downloaded by running the following command:

    ./download.sh datasets_models_urls.txt
  
You will need about 820MB space on your HDD. Datasets will be stored in ./datasets directory and models, with corresponding split files, in ./data/models and       ./data/splits respectively.

If you wish to create your own preprocessed datasets, follow the guide as provided in VASNet repository.
